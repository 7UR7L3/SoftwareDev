snippet1
	variable and class names are garbage
	there could be better comments / documentation
	the path could be passed in as a command line argument or could run in the current directory instead of the random path
	what is self.path vs self.p?
	could structure alarm/door/img as a dictionary / hash directly updating whichever literal is evaluated
	av doesn't seem to do anything
	i doesn't need to be defined as 1 initially
	could structure the poll recursively so the thread wait isn't separate from the while True
	should actually implement something that utilizes the count of file types, now it doens't do anything
	could set paths in r instead of in __init__
	there's probably something that already exists for this
	the print should be uncommented

snippet2
	comments should be for other people, not yourself
	should make main main with __name__ == '__main__'
	should use os.path methods for filepath construction
	should set self.path or expect it as input

snippet3
	can print on one line in stop
	fix self.path
	while true could be better expressed as recursive polling

snippet4
	shouldn't directly use bash as listdir is imported and is better
	the comment for avg was useful as its implementation wasn't expected
